> This is a project to explore how to generate 2D floor plan using different methods.

## Archi-GAN ##
The 1st method I tried is called Archi-GAN, an method posted in 2019.
![Demo](/img/t2d-archi.png)

### Dataset ###
TELL2DESIGN--This is from a research <Tell2Design: A Dataset for Language-Guided Floor Plan Generation> in 2023.

### Process ###
Load Data --> Resize & Pre-process --> Split to train & test sets --> Train Model (/w 200 epoches & 500 epoches) --> Predict

### Test Record ###

![Demo](/img/t2d-train-time.png)
With 200 epoches, it cost 250 minutes. With 500 epoches, it cost 700 minutes. (Maybe I need a faster computer)

### Generated Floor Plan ###

As shown in the outputs, the results are really poor :(
I'll try some other methods later.

> A Big Step Forward! ;)

## GAT-NET ##
I tried the project codes of GAT-NET, and successfully generated floorplan.
### Architecture ###
![Demo](/img/gat-archi.png)

It looks a little bit complicated. But the idea is very clear. Firstly, the centroids are estimated and then the boundaries of the spaces are generated.

### Test Case ###
![Demo](/img/gat-testcase.png)

This is the original layout.

![Demo](/img/gat-boundary.png)

Here is the boundary.

![Demo](/img/gat-centroids.png)

Here is the centroids which are generated by CNN. I will find out how does this part work:)

![Demo](/img/gat-generated.png)

Done! The generated floorplan is shown. It looks not bad, at least reasonable from my perspective of view.

Lots of question marks are in my mind. But, it is a good start!
